Introduction
------------

The CakeAdmin Plugin is built to provide developers with a back end for their application. Every application needs a
back end for the developer to show insights, and manage the data (like users, blogs, pages...).
The CakeAdmin Plugin is easily to install and use. It doesn't hurt your own code, so you can install and uninstall it
everytime you want.
