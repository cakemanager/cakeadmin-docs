Coding Standards
================

CakePHP developers will use the PSR-2 coding style guide in addition to the following rules as coding standards.

It is recommended that others developing CakeIngredients follow the same standards.

You can use the [CakePHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp-codesniffer) to check that your code follows 
required standards.

A guide to work with Code Sniffer will be documented soon.
